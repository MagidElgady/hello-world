# hello-world
I'm learning how to create repositories in GitHub.

Hi! I'm Magid and I'm new to learning GitHub as well as the Python programming language.
I first learnt C/C++ at university but have since lost some of the knowledge I gained and I thought that Python would be the best way
to get back in to it. The reason is the user-friendly syntax in Python compared to C/C++.
